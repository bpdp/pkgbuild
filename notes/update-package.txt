To update package, here's what we need to do:
1.  Download source code
2.  Put into the directory (whatever directory)
3.  cd into the directory
4.  put PKGBUILD into the directory
5.  makepkg -g => to generate md5sums
6.  edit md5sums in PKGBUILD to reflect the generated md5sums
7.  makepkg
8.  when package building has been finished, su - into root
    then 'pacman-color -U package'
9.  makepkg --source => to generate source to be uploaded to AUR
10. Login at AUR
11. Flag package as outdate
12. Select 'Submit'
13. Upload the source which has been generated from step 9
14. Voila! AUR will be updated using the new package PKGBUILD.
